# Quickstart Angular.js

Self-documenting, basic prototypes/examples to get started with Angular JS (1.x). Here for me (and others?) to refer back to.

## Examples (in `src`)

 1. NgAppOnly - No related JS file, just some simple things that you can do on-page with Angular without writing an app module or controller.
 2. NgController - How to add a simple Controller to the app
 3. NgIncludeViews - Using `ng-include` to switch views in a single page app.
