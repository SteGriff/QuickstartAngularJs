# Quickstart Angular.js

Self-documenting, basic prototypes/examples to get started with Angular JS (1.x). Here for me (and others?) to refer back to.

## Examples (in `src`)

 1. [NgAppOnly](src/1.NgAppOnly.htm) - No related JS file, just some simple things that you can do on-page with Angular without writing an app module or controller
 2. [NgController](src/2.NgController.htm) - How to add a simple Controller to the app
 3. [NgIncludeViews](src/3.NgIncludeViews.htm) - Using `ng-include` to switch views in a single page app
 4. [HttpService](src/4.HttpService.htm) - Use `$http` service in a controller to do XHR stuff
 5. [LocalStorage](src/5.LocalStorage.htm) - Use [grevory/angular-local-storage][grev] to preserve values over page Refresh
